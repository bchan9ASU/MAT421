        "Loan approval is a crucial process for financial institutions. Traditionally, lenders assess applications based on factors like **income, credit score, and employment status** to determine whether an applicant qualifies for a loan.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project aims to build a **logistic regression model** to predict whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant features. By automating this process, banks can make data-driven lending decisions faster and more efficiently.\n",
